## Hi! Welcome to My Pages

This is a page about the code side of me. 
A few things first. I use my repository as a pin-board/collection/bookmark. I fork a lot of other people's cool stuff to remind me what kind of resources I have. For everything that is forked, I will put `[*Forked*]` in the title or the description so you know. Hope this explanation make sense :) Sorry if it is weird, I just like to have everything in the same place so I can find them easily. 

### Some Python data science stuff 



Cool stuff I found on the way:
1. [An intro to data science in python, with pandas and scikit learn, using linear regression](https://becominghuman.ai/linear-regression-in-python-with-pandas-scikit-learn-72574a2ec1a5)










You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/INPUTrrr0/RebeccaWang.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/INPUTrrr0/RebeccaWang.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
